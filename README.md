# ML-Fraud-Detection
**<p>Detecting credit card fraud using classic ML algorithms. Nothing fancy here.</p>**
<p>Credit card fraud is a growing issue with many challenges including temporal drift and heavy class imbalance. The dataset used contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 in case of a genuine transaction.</p>
<p>This repository was created to practice applying ML algorithms on imbalanced dataset(clone the repository to get the dataset used). Primarily, Random Forest Classifier was used to predict whether a transaction was a fraud or genuine.</p>
<p>For accuracy comparison purpose another algorithm i.e. Isolation Forest is used.</p>
